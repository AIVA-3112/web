   - Windows batch script for easy deployment
   - Automates the Nixpacks build process

## Files Modified

1. **[package.json](file:///c%3A/Users/chint/Downloads/webapp_1%20-%20Copy/package.json)**
   - Updated the `preview` script to bind to all interfaces (`--host 0.0.0.0`)
   - Removed server-related scripts and dependencies
   - Ensures the application is accessible when deployed in containers

2. **[vite.config.ts](file:///c%3A/Users/chint/Downloads/webapp_1%20-%20Copy/vite.config.ts)**
   - Added `preview` configuration with proper host and port settings
   - Enhanced build configuration with code splitting for optimization
   - Configured output directory and asset handling

3. **[README.md](file:///c%3A/Users/chint/Downloads/webapp_1%20-%20Copy/README.md)**
   - Added a "Deployment with Nixpacks" section
   - Provides quick start instructions for Nixpacks deployment
   - References the detailed deployment guide

## Key Features

### Automatic Detection
- Nixpacks automatically detects this as a Vite + React application
- No manual Dockerfile required for basic deployment

### Optimized Build Process
- Production-ready build with code splitting
- Dependency optimization
- Proper asset handling

### Easy Deployment
- Single command deployment: `nixpacks build . -n my-app`
- Support for container registries
- Health check endpoint for verification

### Configuration Flexibility
- Customizable through [nixpacks.toml](file:///c%3A/Users/chint/Downloads/webapp_1%20-%20Copy/nixpacks.toml)
- Environment variable support
- Build argument customization

## Usage

### Quick Start
```bash
# Build the application
nixpacks build . -n aiva-frontend

# Run locally
docker run -p 5173:5173 aiva-frontend
```

### Using the Deployment Script
```cmd
# On Windows
deploy-nixpacks.bat

# Or with a custom app name
deploy-nixpacks.bat my-custom-app
```

## Benefits

1. **Zero Configuration**: Nixpacks automatically handles the Docker image creation
2. **Optimized Images**: Multi-stage builds with minimal image size
3. **Fast Builds**: Caching and parallel processing for faster builds
4. **Flexible Deployment**: Works with any container registry or hosting platform
5. **Easy Testing**: Simple local testing with Docker

These changes enable seamless packaging and deployment of the frontend application using Nixpacks while maintaining compatibility with existing development workflows. The application is now a standalone frontend that can be deployed independently of any backend services.
