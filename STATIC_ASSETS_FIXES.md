# Static Assets Issues and Fixes

## Issues Identified

1. **Favicon Not Loading**: 
   - The favicon was not displaying when running with `node server.js`
   - The index.html file referenced `/alyasra-black.png` but the actual file was named `alyasrablack.png`
   - The favicon image was not being copied to the dist directory during the build process

2. **Static Assets Not Copied**: 
   - Static assets (like images) in the root directory were not being copied to the dist directory during build
   - This caused broken image references when serving the built application

## Root Cause

The root cause was a mismatch between the filename referenced in index.html and the actual filename, combined with the favicon not being placed in the correct directory for Vite to copy it during the build process.

## Solution Applied

1. **Fixed Filename Reference**:
   - Updated index.html to reference the correct filename `/alyasrablack.png` instead of `/alyasra-black.png`

2. **Proper Asset Placement**:
   - Moved the favicon image (`alyasrablack.png`) to the `public` directory
   - Vite automatically copies all files from the `public` directory to the root of the `dist` directory during build

3. **Rebuilt the Application**:
   - Ran `npm run build` to ensure the favicon is correctly copied to the dist directory

## Code Changes

### Before (Not Working):
```html
<!-- index.html -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/alyasra-black.png" />
```

File structure:
```
project-root/
├── alyasrablack.png  (in root, not copied during build)
├── index.html  (references wrong filename)
└── public/
    └── health.html
```

### After (Working):
```html
<!-- index.html -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/alyasrablack.png" />
```

File structure:
```
project-root/
├── alyasrablack.png
├── index.html  (references correct filename)
└── public/
    ├── alyasrablack.png  (copied here for build)
    └── health.html
```

## Testing Results

1. ✅ Favicon loads correctly: `curl -I http://localhost:8080/alyasrablack.png` returns 200 OK
2. ✅ Main page loads correctly: `curl -I http://localhost:8080/` returns 200 OK
3. ✅ All static assets are properly served by Express static middleware
4. ✅ Images and icons now display correctly when running `node server.js`

## Why This Solution Works

1. **Correct Filename Reference**: The index.html now references the actual filename that exists
2. **Proper Vite Asset Handling**: By placing the favicon in the `public` directory, Vite automatically copies it to the dist directory during build
3. **Express Static Serving**: The `express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'dist'))` middleware correctly serves all static assets from the dist directory
4. **No Path Conflicts**: The favicon is served from the root of the dist directory, matching the reference in index.html

## Commands for Testing

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the server
node server.js

# Test favicon loading
curl -I http://localhost:8080/alyasrablack.png

# Test main page loading
curl -I http://localhost:8080/

# Test API endpoints still work
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/api/workspaces -H "Authorization: Bearer test-token"
```
